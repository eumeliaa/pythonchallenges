# QUESTION: Create code to search up a monster. You will need to read the text file and enable people to search the file for a monster.

file = open('monsters_simple.txt', 'r')

searchname = input("Name of Monster: ")

found = 'false'
counter = 0

for i in file:
    data = i
    for j in range(1,len(data)):
        counter = counter + 1
        if j == ',':
            name = data[:counter-1]
            if name == searchname:
                print("Found at line", i)
                found = 'true'


if found == 'false':
    print("Monster is not in the file")
